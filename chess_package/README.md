## Code
The main places to write code are `setup_phase()` and `play_phase()` inside `/bot/start_code/python/bot.py`

- For setup_phase(), it will be called 5 times for 5 steps.
* Need to look at setupStep of game state to decide which step we are on.
1. Place King
2. Block enemy position
3. Place 2 Rooks (put rook type)
4. Place 2 bishops & 3 pawns (put type)
